# Proctor Management System

A college proctor management system is a project that manages and stores proctee information electronically according to the proctor needs. This system helps both the proctor and proctee to keep a constant track of all the proctees under a particular proctor.

This portal enables us register as either a student or a proctor. If you’re logged in as a student, you can edit your profile and set your academic records per semester. You are allowed to set your proctor in the Edit Profile page as well. This means that you can set the marks obtained in each subject for each semester and then forward the same details to a proctor. Once the proctor has received a student’s request, he/she can go through the student details and academic performance and "Sign" the record so as to approve their work. There is a proctee page for each proctor which lists all the proctees under a specific proctor.
